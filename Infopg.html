  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3 class="subheading">What is unweighted GPA and how is it calculated?</h3>
  <p class="text2">Unweighted GPA is your Grade Point average solely based on the grades your receive in your classes.
    Each letter grade has a numerical value relating to it. The values for each grade are added up and divided by the
    total number of classes, forming your unweighted GPA.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">What is weighted GPA and how is it calculated?</h3>
  <p class="text2">Your Weighted GPA takes into account the level of the classes you are taking. AP and Honors Classes
    boost your weighted GPA. It is calculated by taking the unweighted GPA, multiplying it by the number of classes,
    adding 1.0 for each AP or Honors course taken, and dividing that total by the class count.</p>

    Then, click the calculator tab at the navigation bar on top to get started!
    Click the add course button to add your classes one by one. Enter the letter grade and course type for each one.
     Once you're done, simply click the 'Calculate' Button and you will get your weighted and unweighted GPA displayed on
