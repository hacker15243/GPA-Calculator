  <p class = "subheading">Want to improve your GPA, but don't know how? Well, you've come to the right place! The following is a list of things you can do to get better grades and form consistent study habits</p>
  <ul class = "resources">
    <li><b>Use a Planner: </b> This will help you organize all your tasks in one place and makey you feel like you know what you're doing :) </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Stop Procrastinating: </b> The number one problem for high school students in modern times is procrastination. Limit your screen time on social media and unproductive apps, so that you can focus completely on your work without distractions. When you work without distractions, you retain study content much better!</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Ask Your Teachers For Extra Practice: </b> Figure out what your weak subjects are, and ask those teachers for extra practice material. Turn your weakness into your strength! </li><br>
    <li><b>Take Care of Your Mental Health: </b>Mental Health is just as important as physical health. You cannot study or focus if you're burnt out or have brain drain. This is why it's important to take breaks. Don't study for hours on end, and make sure to get the right amount of sleep, water, food, and excersize. Your GPA cannot improve if your brain is tired. </li>
  </ul>
